Project: The Vietnamese Family in Era 4.0 - Tradition & Modernity
Welcome! This is a creative project for the MLN131 (Scientific Socialism) course.

This web application, built with Google AI Studio, serves as an interactive analysis of the theme: "The Vietnamese Family in Era 4.0: Tradition and Modernity."

The project's goal is to apply the theories from Chapter 7 of the "Scientific Socialism" textbook to analyze and visualize the profound transformations of the Vietnamese family. It explores the impacts of the market economy, urbanization, and international integration on family structures, functions, and relationships.

Key Features
This site is more than a simple presentation; it's an interactive product that includes:

Analysis of Change: Visualizing the shift in family structure (from multi-generational to nuclear families), functions (changes in economic and educational roles), and relationships (generational conflicts, spousal relations).

The Intersection of Values: Highlighting the preservation of traditional values (like filial piety, faithfulness, and mutual support) alongside the adoption of modern values (like equality, democracy, and shared responsibilities).

Data & Visuals: Integrating an image gallery, interactive effects, and infographics (on family size, divorce rates, internet impact) to support the theoretical arguments.
